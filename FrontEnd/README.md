- **images/**: All project-related images.
- **fonts/**: Custom fonts used across the project.

- **utils.js**: Common utility functions like date formatting or data transformations.
- **hooks/**: Custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable logic.

### pages/

This folder includes the different pages of the application. Each page is organized in its own subfolder, containing the main page component and any specific components used only within that page. Each page is generally associated with a route in the app and often utilizes shared components and layouts.

  - **/components/**: Contains components that are only used on the Contact page.


### routes/

This folder defines the routing logic for the application. It may include route definitions, route guards, and any dynamic routing configurations.

- **index.js**: Contains all route definitions for the app, linking the URLs to the pages.
